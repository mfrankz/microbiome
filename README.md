# microbiome: Downstream analysis and plotting of 16s microbiome data in R using phyloseq and ggplot
### This tutorial will allow you to create publication-level graphs and convert phyloseq objects to dataframes for easier manipulation and analysis

To follow this tutorial, you will need 16s data that has already been processed into an ASV table and converted into a phyloseq object. We will use the phyloseq object created in the [dada2 Github tutorial for R users](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html). You can create the object yourself using the dada2 tutorial or import mine here.
